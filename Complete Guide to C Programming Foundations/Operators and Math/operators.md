sizeof

Note: 
sizeof is both an operator and C language keyword. 

Sizeof works on a variable, array or a chunk of memory. It returns a size_t value, which is an unsigned positive integer, representing the number of bytes of memory the item occupies. You must include the stdio.h header file to use the size_t typedef in your code, the operator's used most often when allocating memory or dealing with pointers.
